# camera_view
Topside package. Displays the cameras adds the overlay.
Listens for a ping from cameras on 192.168.1.100:12345, and once it detects the ping, it streams video from 192.168.1:5000.
Can be launched before or after cameras have begun streaming, and more cameras can be added automatically mid session.
